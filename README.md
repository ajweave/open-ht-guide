# Introduction

## About this Guide

This is an open Guide. It’s open to contributions, so, unlike a blog or forum thread, it is living, and can be improved. While a lot of information on this topic is just a Google search away or located on Home Theater forums, it is scattered about in many different places. This document was started by [Kyle Lamy](https://github.com/flynfish). It’s a preliminary version, and no doubt has some errors and shortcomings, but I want to see it evolve.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have an idea or contribution that might improve this Guide, please request permission to become a writer and Questions are also welcome \(as issues\), as they help us next time we revise the guide. We gladly credit all contributors.
