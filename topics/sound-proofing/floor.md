# Floor

## Best Practice  

* 1/2 inch rubber mat \(Serenity Mat\) secured to floor with DA5 adhesive 3/16 v notch trowel
* 3/4 T&G OSB glued with DA5 to mat. OSB floated with no mechanical fasteners.
* Stage and Riser built on top of sub-floor.
* Locally sourced Horse Stall mats can be substituted if available cheaper \(Tractor Supply\)
