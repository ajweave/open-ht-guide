#### Good

Frame in front of the foundation leaving a gap, build the frame one inch short and secure the top plate with IB3 clips at the ends of the wall and every 48 inches. Insulate with the cheapest fiberglass you can find filling the framing. If required by local codes insulate the walls with locally accepted standards like foam sheets or other systems then build the walls in front and not touching the insulation system, insulate the framing cavities. Apply drywall directly to studs, use two layers of 5/8 with the full recommended amount of Green Glue. Address all the holes you cut in the drywall shell with backer boxes or putty pads.

#### Better

Lay a 1/2 inch rubber mat \(you can cut strips from horse stall mats\) under the bottom plate. consider 3 layers of DW

#### Best

Use clips and channel on the decoupled framing, Consider 3 layers. A master room
